# IcebergExplorerROV
This is a public repository for the Oregon State University ECE 44x Iceberg Explorer ROV Project. The client of this project is Dr. Jonathan Nash of Oregon State University 

# Overview

The goal of this project was to modify a (BlueRov2)[https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/] to add the capability to
- attach to an iceberg and hold itself securely in place
- take measurements of the rate at which the iceberg was melting

The primary development that took place between the 2019-2020 school year focused on designing and prototyping of the first capability -- to attach securely to an iceberg. Additionally, our team created requirements and design concepts for the entire system that could be useful going forwards. 

# Iceberg Attachment Overview

When our ECE team was in its brainstorming phase, we decided to forgo physically drilling into the ice, an idea inspired by (ice climbing equipment)[https://www.rei.com/product/860670/petzl-laser-speed-ice-screw], to a much more mechanically simple method of melting into the ice and refreezing the hole created around our attachment points. For further information, including pattents that cover similar designs used previously, consult the written report on (Iceberg Attachment)[TODO].
